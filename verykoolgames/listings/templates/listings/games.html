<h1>List of games</h1>
<p>Since the begining of our collaboration, we have created {{games|length}} game{%if games|length > 1%}s{%else%}{%endif%}. By order of creation, the oldest games are listed first :</p>
<ul>
    {% for game in games%}
    <li><a href="{% url 'games_detail' game.id %}">{{ game.title }}</a></li>
    {% endfor%}
